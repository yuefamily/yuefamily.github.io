    <h2>How It's Made</h2>
    <p>The magic begins with golden, crispy fries that are cooked to perfection. These fries serve as the delicious base for the toppings that follow.</p>
    <p>Next, a generous ladle of warm, flavorful gravy is poured over the fries. The gravy adds a savory depth that perfectly complements the crispiness of the fries.</p>
    <p>Lastly, a generous sprinkle of melted cheese is added, providing a creamy and gooey texture that brings the dish together in the most delightful way.</p>
