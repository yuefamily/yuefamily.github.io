<h2>Lin daiyu is a female character from the traditional Chinese novel named "<i>The Dream of the Red Mansions</i>"written by Cao xueqin(曹雪芹) in ancien China.In her previous life, she was the Crimson Pearl Fairy in the illusory realm. The purpose of coming to this world is to repay Shenying wfor his kindness of watering with her own tears. This is a special image of an ancient boudoir woman who is sentimental, lonely and self-admired, and uncontaminated with worldliness. She is very talented in poetry, and has written "Autumn Window and Wind and Rain", "Three Wonders", "Burning Flowers" and so on. Wang Wenjuan accurately grasped the inner emotions of the characters, and created this eternal classic character on the stage of Yue opera with her delicate expression skills.Classic fragments such as Daiyu's burial of flowers and Daiyu's burning of manuscripts in the play are widely circulated and popular.</h2>

<h2>"The Story of the West Garden", a legendary work in the late Ming Dynasty in China. Written by <i>Wu Bing</i>（吴炳）. The drama plays Wang Yuzhen and Zhao Yuying（赵玉英）, who live together in Zhao's Garden. Scholar Zhang Jihua meets Wang Yuzhen by chance in the West Garden. He fall in love with her at first sight, but they mistake her for Zhao Yuying. Soon, Zhao Yuying died of illness, and Zhang was distraught. Later, he met Yuzhen again in Xiyuan and thought it was Yuying's ghost. Zhang misses Yuying with affection, and calls her by name late at night. Zhao's father wanted to marry Yuzhen to Jihua, but he refused. After maid Xiangyun（香筠） persuaded, the misunderstanding was resolved and they got married. "The Story of the West Garden" is delicate in description and ingenious in its artistic conception. It promotes the development of the plot through misunderstandings of truth and falsehood, and misunderstandings between humans and ghosts.</h2>

<h2><left>Scholar Zhang Zhen had a marriage contract with the prime minister's daughter Mudan（牡丹）, and after her parents died , she went to the prime minister's mansion. <br>Seeing that he has no money and power, the prime minister ordered him to temporarily live in a thatched hut beside the Bibo Lake in the back garden to study, but in his heart he wanted to find a chance to regret the marriage.
Zhang Zhen was depressed, and often went to the pool alone to lament her worries. The carp spirit in the pool admired Zhang Zhen's kindness and simplicity, so she turned into a peony to meet him in the study, and the two fell in love with each other.<br>Chasing the fish is a very difficult play, and the martial arts scene is extremely difficult. The actors must have both civil and military skills. It is necessary to ensure that there are no mistakes in the singing of the literary opera, but also to ensure the completion and quality of the martial arts scene. In particular, Wang Wenjuan asked the Peking Opera teacher for advice on body movements, and vividly demonstrated the playful and agile characteristics of the carp spirit through the flexible use of stage steps. In the play, she plays two roles by herself. Wang Wenjuan accurately grasps the heat, and also has a good creation for the role of Jin Mudan, which reflects the difference in character.

<h2>It is written that <i>Chunxiang</i>, the daughter of <i>Yuemei</i>(月梅）, a geisha in Namwon Prefecture in the middle of the Lee Dynasty in North Korea, met <i>Li Menglong</i>(李梦龙）, a son of a local envoy in front of Guanghan Tower, and they fell in love with each other and made a private century-old contract. Soon, the envoy was transferred to Hanyang, and Menglong was ordered to accompany him, but Chunxiang was not allowed to go with him. Menglong had no choice but to part with Chunxiang reluctantly, and made an appointment to pick her up after winning the exam. Three years later,<i> Bian Xuedao(卞学道）</i>, the new envoy, envied Chunxiang and wanted to take over, but Chunxiang refused and was sentenced to death. Shi Menglong has been appointed as the censor. After hearing the news, he rushed to Nanyuan to investigate and deal with Bian Xuedao, and reunited with Chunxiang.</h2>
